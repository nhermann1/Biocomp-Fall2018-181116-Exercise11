Start with scp to the remote
	ssh to remote
	mkdir gene_sequences
	in local: scp *.fasta (in gene_sequences) to local/ in remote
Then make a file sporecoatALL.fasta
	touch sporecoatALL.fasta makes a blank file
	need to add a return to the end of each sporecoat0*.fasta or they'll start on the same line
	cat sporecoat*.fasta >> sporecoatALL.fasta to put them all in one file
Then use muscle to align sporecoatALL.fasta
	muscleetc -in local/gene_sequences/sporecoatALL.fasta -out local/gene_sequences/alignsporecoat.fasta
Then do the same thing again for transporter
Get The actual script in here for some of this

For the second question
already have an aligned sequence from part 1: aligntransporter.fasta
use hmmbuild 
	local/bin/hmmbuild transporter.hmm aligntransporter.fasta
Now need to search with this through the eight proteomes
	local/bin/hmmsearch --tblout local/gene_sequences/OUTAnthrobacter.txt local/gene_sequences/transporter.hmm local/proteomes/Anthrobacter.fasta
	--tblout will make a text file with just this table
Will search for each of the eight proteomes, changing tblout name each time and proteome being searched each time
Then combine all the tblout together into created all file
	touch OUTtransporter.txt
	cat OUT* >> OUTtransporter.txt
