#That's it for Question 1



For the second question
already have an aligned sequence from part 1: aligntransporter.fasta
use hmmbuild 
	local/bin/hmmbuild transporter.hmm aligntransporter.fasta
Now need to search with this through the eight proteomes
	local/bin/hmmsearch --tblout local/gene_sequences/OUTAnthrobacter.txt local/gene_sequences/transporter.hmm local/proteomes/Anthrobacter.fasta
	--tblout will make a text file with just this table
Will search for each of the eight proteomes, changing tblout name each time and proteome being searched each time
Then combine all the tblout together into created all file
	touch OUTtransporter.txt
	cat OUT* >> OUTtransporter.txt
